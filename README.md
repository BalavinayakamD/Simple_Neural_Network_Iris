### Explanation of the sections:

- **Dataset**: A description of the Iris dataset and its features.
- **Requirements**: This section lists all the necessary libraries needed to run the project, along with the installation instructions.
- **Project Structure**: Describes the organization of the project files.
- **How to Use**: Add a new data point directly into the code and process it.
- **Model Architecture**: There are 4 input(features) and 2 hidden layers with 8 neurons Each with a output layer consisting 3 neurons.
- **Training and Evaluation**: This model is trained with a dataset found online, A csv file by netj.
- **Results**: After training, the model is evaluated on the test data. The model's predictions are compared to the true labels (test labels), and the number of        correct predictions is counted. Finally, the model's accuracy is computed as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of test instances.
- **Performance**: This model performs well with 96.7% accuracy.
